        <P><h3>Battle for Survival of Universe</h3></P>

    <hr noshade="">

    <p>The Tournament of Power planned by <i><b>Zeno</b></i> begins, with multiple universes partakingâ€”with each universe having gathered a team of 10 fighters who battle alongside each other on a stage. The arc features continuous debuts of elites from each universe. However, this also proves to be the beginning of universal destruction.
    <Strong>Goku </Strong>achieves an incomplete transformation that allows him to use <em><b>Ultra Instinct</b></em>; He later completes it, allowing him to use Ultra Instinct to its full potential, though he can't access it at will until much later. <b>Vegeta</b> pushes himself beyond his limits and unlocks an evolved form of <em><strong>Super Saiyan Blue.</strong></em>

    <h2>No Mercy | No Pain | No Weakness </h2>

    <h3>10 Warriors from each Universe should join in this tournment. It is mandatory  to have 10 Warriors. 
    </h3>

    <p>
        Team Universe 7 is a team presented by Beerus, Shin and Whis with the strongest warriors in Universe 7 in order to participate in the Tournament of Destroyers. The team consists of Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Good Buu, and Monaka (introduced as Beerus' strongest opponent) with Beerus and Whis as the team's supervisors.
        Later on, in the Tournament of Power, Team Universe 7 is expanded to 10 members, losing Monaka but adding Gohan, Krillin, Master Roshi, Tien Shinhan, Android 18, and Android 17. Since Majin Buu falls asleep before the tournament, Goku rushes in order to get Frieza as the tenth member of the team.

        <p>Unlike the World Martial Arts Tournament, the Tournament of Power is a survival-style battle royale in which all 80 fighters face each other simultaneously and must knock their opponents off of the ring to defeat them.
        The tournament occurred in the Null Realm, an isolated place outside of the twelve universes with literally no time or space, allowing the participants to use the fullest extent of their powers.
